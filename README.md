# SPA Universe




### ðŸ’» SPA Universe

Build a page with SPA concepts (Single Page Application), are applications whose 
functionality is concentrated in a single page. 
Instead of reloading the entire page or redirecting the user to a page new, only 
the main content is updated asynchronously, keeping all the structure of the static page. 
These are applications whose functionality is concentrated on a single page.
Working with javascript events, asynchronism, promises, concepts of
POO(Object Oriented Programming) with classes, use figma layout as
basis for page style.
